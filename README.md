# YOLOV3-ASSISTANT


We developed a voice assistant ETE(Eye For The Elderly) which is synonymous with elderly
people with vision impairment. This assistant will help them to locate their object of interest.
ETE is built using various Python libraries and frameworks. The implementation process is divided
into three phases, the first phase is to record the users audio via a microphone and store that in
“WAV”(wave file) which is done using python library Pyaudio, the audio in the WAV format is
converted into text using wit.ai and after preprocessing steps the intent found is given to the yolo
model to identify the object required, after finding the object location the Pyttsx3 module will
output the location in the form of audio.
